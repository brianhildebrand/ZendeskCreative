<h4>Do you listen to music while you work? What kind? </h4>
<p>Never without my own obsesively curated soundtrack of the day. Adjusts to the mood of the moment, from Jazz to Electro via some Pop and Disco. (I am sure you were dying to know: This song is playing as I am writing this).</p>

<h4>What is your favorite kind of pen/pencil? </h4>
<p>Theoretically a personalised silver Caran d'Ache pen from my Dad. But what modern digital person still has a silver personalised Caran d'Ache pen at hand when it's actually needed? So really just whatever pen is closest.</p>

<h4>What's the view from your desk? </h4>
<p>A construction site. Noise drowned out by my soundtrack. And a lot of beautiful happy faces that I get to work with (yes, also drowned out by my soundtrack).</p>

<h4>What do you do when you run out of creative energy?</h4> 
<p>I go for a run.</p>
